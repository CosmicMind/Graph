## Entity

An **Entity** is a model object that **represents a person, place, or thing**. For example, a Company, Photo, Video, User, Person, and Note. In code, the following is how this would look.

![GraphEntity](http://cosmicmind.io/GK/GraphEntity.png)

```swift
let graph: Graph = Graph()

// Create a Person Entity.
let elon: Entity = Entity(type: "Person")
elon["firstName"] = "Elon"
elon["lastName"] = "Musk"

let path: String = NSBundle.mainBundle().pathForResource("ElonMusk", ofType: "png")!
elon["photo"] = UIImage(contentsOfFile: path)

graph.save()
```

<a name="relationship"></a>
## Relationship

A **Relationship** is a model object that **forms a relationship between two Entities**. For example, "Mark is an Employee of Facebook". _Mark_ and _Facebook_ are two Entities that form a Relationship -- of type _Employee_. In code, the following is how this would look.

![GraphRelationship](http://cosmicmind.io/GK/GraphRelationship.png)

```swift
let graph: Graph = Graph()

// Create a Person Entity.
let mark: Entity = Entity(type: "Person")
mark["firstName"] = "Mark"
mark["lastName"] = "Zuckerberg"

let path: String = NSBundle.mainBundle().pathForResource("MarkZuckerberg", ofType: "png")!
mark["photo"] = UIImage(contentsOfFile: path)

// Create a Company Entity.
let facebook: Entity = Entity(type: "Company")
facebook["name"] = "Facebook"

// Create an Employee Relationship.
let employee: Relationship = Relationship(type: "Employee")
employee["startDate"] = "February 4, 2004"

// Form the relationship.
employee.subject = mark
employee.object = facebook

graph.save()
```

Notice that information about the relationship is stored within the _Employee_ Relationship leaving both _Mark_ and _Facebook_ to form other relationships freely. This is a key principal when using Relationships.

<a name="action"></a>
## Action

An **Action** is a model object that **forms a relationship between a collection of Entity subjects and a collection of Entity objects**. For example, "Apple Acquired Beats Electronics". The _Acquired_ Action captures the _Company_ Entities in a single relationship that may be used later to ask questions like, "which company acquired Beats Electronics?", or "what companies did Apple acquire?". In code, the following is how this would look.

![GraphAction](http://cosmicmind.io/GK/GraphAction.png)

```swift
let graph: Graph = Graph()

// Create a Company Entity.
let apple: Entity = Entity(type: "Company")
apple["name"] = "Apple"

// Create a Company Entity.
let beats: Entity = Entity(type: "Company")
beats["name"] = "Beats Electronics"

// Create an Acquired Action.
let acquired: Action = Action(type: "Acquired")
acquired["acquisitionDate"] = "May 28, 2014"

// Form the action.
acquired.addSubject(apple)
acquired.addObject(beats)

graph.save()
```

Notice that information about the action is stored within the _Acquired_ Action leaving both _Apple_ and _Beats Electronics_ to form other actions freely. This is a key principal when using Actions.

<a name="groups"></a>
## Groups

Groups are used to organize Entities, Relationships, and Actions into different collections from their types. This allows multiple types to exist in a single collection. For example, a Photo and Video Entity type may exist in a group called Media. Another example may be including a Photo and Book Entity type in a Favorites group for your users' account. Below are examples of using groups.

```swift
let graph: Graph = Graph()

let photo: Entity = Entity(type: "Photo")
photo.addGroup("Media")
photo.addGroup("Favorites")
photo.addGroup("Holiday Album")

let video: Entity = Entity(type: "Video")
video.addGroup("Media")

let book: Entity = Entity(type: "Book")
book.addGroup("Favorites")
book.addGroup("To Read")

graph.save()

// Searching groups.
let favorites: Array<Entity> = graph.searchForEntity(groups: ["Favorites"])
```

<a name="datadriven"></a>
## Data Driven

As data moves through your application, the state of information may be observed to create a reactive experience. Below is an example of watching when a "User Clicked a Button".

```swift
// Set the UIViewController's Protocol to GraphDelegate.
let graph: Graph = Graph()
graph.delegate = self

graph.watchForAction(types: ["Clicked"])

let user: Entity = Entity(type: "User")
let clicked: Action = Action(type: "Clicked")
let button: Entity = Entity(type: "Button")

clicked.addSubject(user)
clicked.addObject(button)

graph.save()

// Delegate method.
func graphDidInsertAction(graph: Graph, action: Action) {
    switch(action.type) {
    case "Clicked":
      print(action.subjects.first?.type) // User
      print(action.objects.first?.type) // Button
    case "Swiped":
      // Handle swipe.
    default:break
    }
 }
```

<a name="facetedsearch"></a>
## Faceted Search

To explore the intricate relationships within Graph, the search API adopts a faceted design. The below examples show how to use the _Graph_ search API:

Searching multiple Entity types.

```swift
let graph: Graph = Graph()
let collection: Array<Entity> = graph.searchForEntity(types: ["Photo", "Video"])
```

Searching multiple Entity groups.

```swift
let graph: Graph = Graph()
let collection: Array<Entity> = graph.searchForEntity(groups: ["Media", "Favorites"])
```

Searching multiple Entity properties.

```swift
let graph: Graph = Graph()
let collection: Array<Entity> = graph.searchForEntity(properties: [(key: "name", value: "Eve"), ("age", 27)])
```

Searching multiple facets simultaneously will aggregate all results into a single collection.

```swift
let graph: Graph = Graph()
let collection: Array<Entity> = graph.searchForEntity(types: ["Photo", "Friends"], groups: ["Media", "Favorites"])
```

Filters may be used to narrow in on a search result. For example, searching a book title and group within purchases.

```swift
let graph: Graph = Graph()

let collection: Array<Action> = graph.searchForAction(types: ["Purchased"]).filter { (action: Action) -> Bool in
	if let entity: Entity = action.objects.first {
		if "Book" == entity.type && "The Holographic Universe" == entity["title"] as? String  {
			return entity.hasGroup("Physics")
		}
	}
	return false
}
```
