## Installation

> **Embedded frameworks require a minimum deployment target of iOS 12.**
> - [Download Graph](https://github.com/CosmicMind/Graph/archive/master.zip)

## Swift Package Manager
To add Graph to a [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) based project, add:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/CosmicMind/Graph", .branch("development")),
```
to your `Package.swift` files `dependencies` array.

## CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate Graph's core features into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'Graph', '~> 3.1.0'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

## Carthage

Carthage is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with Homebrew using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```
To integrate Graph into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your Cartfile:

```bash
github "CosmicMind/Graph"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `Graph.framework` into your Xcode project.

## Changelog

Graph is a growing project and will encounter changes throughout its development. It is recommended that the [Changelog](https://github.com/CosmicMind/Graph/wiki/Changelog) be reviewed prior to updating versions.

# Samples

The following are samples to see how Graph may be used within your applications.

* Visit the [Samples](https://github.com/CosmicMind/Samples) repo to see example projects using Graph.

## Creating an Entity for an ImageCard

An **Entity** is a model (data) object that represents a **person**, **place**, or **thing**. It may store property values, be a member of groups, and can be tagged.

In the following example, we create an ImageCard view using Material and populate it's properties with an Entity that stores the data for that view.

![Material ImageCard](http://www.cosmicmind.com/gifs/white/image-card.gif)

#### Creating data

```swift
let graph = Graph()

let entity = Entity(type: "ImageCard")
entity["title"] = "Graph"
entity["detail"] = "Build Data-Driven Software"
entity["content"] = "Graph is a semantic database that is used to create data-driven applications."
entity["author"] = "CosmicMind"
entity["image"] = UIImage.load(contentsOfFile: "frontier", ofType: "jpg")

graph.sync()
```

#### Setting the view's properties

```swift
imageCard.toolbar?.title = entity["title"] as? String
imageCard.toolbar?.detail = entity["detail"] as? String
imageCard.imageView?.image = entity["image"] as? UIImage

let contentLabel = UILabel()
contentLabel.text = entity["content"] as? String
imageCard.contentView = contentLabel

let authorLabel = UILabel()
authorLabel.text = entity["author"] as? String
imageCard.bottomBar?.centerViews = [authorLabel]
```

## Searching a list of users in realtime

Using the **Search** API is incredibly flexible. In the following example, Search is used to create a live search on user names with a dynamic UI provided by [Material's SearchBar](http://cosmicmind.com/material/searchbar).

![Material SearchBar](http://www.cosmicmind.com/gifs/shared/search-bar-controller.gif)

#### Preparing the search criteria

```swift
let graph = Graph()

let search = Search<Entity>(graph: graph).for(types: "User").where(properties: "name")
```

#### Asynchronously searching graph

```swift        
search.async { [weak self, pattern = pattern] (users) in

	guard let regex = try? NSRegularExpression(pattern: pattern, options: []) else {
	    return
    }

	var data = [Entity]()

	for user in users {
		if let name = user["name"] as? String {
			let matches = regex.matches(in: name, range: NSRange(location: 0, length: name.utf16.count))

			if 0 < matches.count {
				data.append(user)
			}
		}
	}

	self?.tableView.data = data
}
```
